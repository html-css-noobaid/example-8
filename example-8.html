		<blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">
			<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. 
				It describes and defines the content of a webpage. Other technologies besides HTML are generally
				used to describe a webpage's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality (JavaScript).</p>
			<p>"HyperText" refers to links that connect webpages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. 
				Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web.
				By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become
				 an active participant in the World Wide Web. </p>
